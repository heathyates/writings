The second is wushu-scrolls which is a collection of various notes that I use as documentation as I work on my various projects.\nThe reasons for me naming them the way I did are explained in the repos themselves, but in brief the idea is to learn technologies and practice coding. The first repo is a practice repo of coding problems. The second repo is sometihng I have put together myself with my own notes that is both my documenation, notes, and shortcuts as I work with various technologies."
