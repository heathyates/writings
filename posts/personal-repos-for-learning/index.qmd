There are two repos I am currently working on to both enhance my skills and be a resource to other learners. 
The first is called [wushu-code](https://github.com/heathyates/wushu-code) which is a collection of leetcode type problems and solutions. The second 
is [wushu-scrolls](https://github.com/heathyates/wushu-scrolls) which is a collection of various notes that I use as documentation as I work on my various
projects. 

The reasons for me naming them the way I did are explained in the repos themselves, but in brief the idea is to learn technologies and practice coding. The first repo is a practice repo of coding problems. 
The second repo is sometihng I have put together myself with my own notes that is both my documenation, notes, and shortcuts as I work with various technologies.
