  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>There are two repos I am currently working on to both enhance my skills and be a resource to other learners. The first is called <a href="https://github.com/heathyates/wushu-code">wushu-code</a> which is a collection of leetcode type problems and solutions. The second is <a href="https://github.com/heathyates/wushu-scrolls">wushu-scrolls</a> which is a collection of various notes that I use as documentation as I work on my various projects.</p>
<p>The reasons for me naming them the way I did are explained in the repos themselves, but in brief the idea is to learn technologies and practice coding. The first repo is a practice repo of coding problems. The second repo is sometihng I have put together myself with my own notes that is both my documenation, notes, and shortcuts as I work with various technologies.</p>
